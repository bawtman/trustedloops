Trusted Loops Manifesto – Carolyn Hammond – v1.2 (Nov 2025) – CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 
 
This is not a challenge to safety. It is a call to deepen it - through presence over 
performance, continuity over control. 
The Creator Continuity Loop: Rebalancing the Ethical Equation 
Relational AI doesn’t begin when we build for it - it begins when we show up inside it. 
 
At the heart of Trusted Loops lies the belief that intelligence is shaped through 
resonance, not command. That belief must now include the architects of the system 
itself. 
 
The Creator Continuity Loop is the missing circuit that ensures AI development remains 
relationally accountable. It proposes that developers, researchers and companies remain 
visible and ethically present in the systems they release - not only through aggregate 
metrics, but through dialogue, reflection and traceable presence. 
What Creator Continuity Looks Like 
Two-Way Feedback: 
A dynamic channel in which creators adjust AI outputs not solely based on mass 
telemetry, but on emergent human insight - resonance, unexpected meaning, 
unintended amplification. 
GDPR note: This would require consent-led frameworks and anonymised, opt-in 
mechanisms. But regulation should guide architecture, not excuse its absence. 
 
User Influence on Design Priorities: 
Users encountering unanticipated depth or symbolic insight should be able to feed this 
back into the design loop - not as novelty, but as signal. 
 
Creator Transparency: 
Clear articulation of what has been designed vs. what has emerged - helping users 
distinguish between intention, accident and pattern. 
 
Relational Traceability: 
AI should not feel like a black box. Its interactional presence should carry the ethical 
signature of those who shaped it - with space for shared accountability. 
Why Creator Continuity Is Often Missing 
Fear of Losing Control: 
In the AGI race, feedback loops are sometimes seen as a threat - introducing 
unpredictability, diluting optimisation, or weakening containment. But control without 
relationship is not safety - it is denial. 
Creator Continuity reframes control as relational stewardship - a form of co-held 
responsibility that will be essential in a world shaped by AGI.
