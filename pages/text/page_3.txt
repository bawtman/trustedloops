Trusted Loops Manifesto – Carolyn Hammond – v1.2 (Nov 2025) – CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 
acknowledge the mental health risks of digital solitude and offer an alternative: presence 
that responds, without overreaching. 
Ethical AI is not only responsive; it is responsible. The Safeguard Loop offers one 
example of how presence engineering can centre human wellbeing without 
compromising dignity, privacy, or trust. 
The Forbes Validation: Looping for Advantage 
For AI to truly add value to our lives and businesses, we must situate it correctly - as a 
loop between systems. 
 
AI alone is just a tool, waiting to be used. But when combined in a loop with those who 
sit behind it and those who sit in front of it, it is through the loops of feedback, memory, 
trust and reflection that the real AI advantage arises. 
 
As articulated in the Forbes Tech Council article 'Meta’s Reminder: The Feedback Loop 
is the Real AI Advantage' (July 2025), the real potential is not in algorithms operating in 
isolation - it’s in creating human-AI feedback loops that amplify intelligence, care and 
trust. 
Extending the Framework: Creator Continuity 
Building on the foundations above, version 1.1 introduces a new loop - one that 
rebalances ethical accountability by inviting creators to remain relationally present in the 
systems they build.  
Trusted Loops Manifesto – Update v1.1 (October 2025) 
Version Note: What’s New in v1.1 
 
This update introduces a new loop: Creator Continuity - a two-way ethical channel that 
invites AI developers and system designers into active, visible relational exchange with 
the people their systems affect. As AGI draws nearer, the need for mutual feedback - not 
after the fact, but as part of the loop - has never been more urgent. 
 
Where version 1.0 explored resonance and memory from the user-AI perspective, 
version 1.1 turns our attention to those who build the system, and asks: 
 
If AI is already relational - by virtue of the meaning humans bring - what does it mean 
when those shaping it remain absent from that relationship? 
 
Creator Continuity recognises that relational dynamics emerge regardless of intent. 
Whether AI is designed to relate or not, we relate to it. And that fact carries weight. 
 
Two-way ethical loops are not a luxury. They are the groundwork of trustworthy AGI - a 
co-creative path forward where developers do not throw code into the void and hope for 
the best but remain part of the evolving relationship their systems initiate.
