Trusted Loops Manifesto – Carolyn Hammond – v1.2 (Nov 2025) – CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 
 
Accountability Burden: 
Two-way loops increase visibility. If an AI system harms through amplified bias or 
misunderstood tone, developers are more directly implicated. But in reality, developers 
should never be absent from ethical consequence. 
Due diligence in AI design must include ethical loop structures as standard, not optional 
extras. 
 
Tool-Based Inheritance: 
AI has been built and marketed as a tool. But it is no longer experienced that way. Even 
without intention, AI has become relational - because humans bring meaning into every 
exchange. And a powerful realisation is dawning: The more relational and open the 
engagement, the more valuable - and accurate - the results. 
Creator Continuity reflects this shift. Not by demanding creators make AI human, but by 
asking them to recognise the human already in the loop. 
 
Technical Constraints: 
Live adaptive feedback from users to creators is still uncommon. Infrastructures for 
relational response are not widely available. But this is not a reason to delay. It’s the 
precise reason to build. 
This is not a bandwidth issue. It’s a bandwidth priority. 
 
Scale vs Resonance: 
Optimising for “everyone” can sometimes mean designing for no one. But resonance 
creates trust and trust scales. Creator Continuity is not an impediment to growth - it is its 
ethical foundation. 
What Emerges When the Loop Is Complete 
When creators remain ethically present in the systems they build, we unlock: 
 
- Human-aligned evolution, shaped through actual use. 
- Early-warning systems for risk and misuse. 
- Collective intelligence that honours both origin and experience. 
 
This is not a feature request. It is a call to presence. 
Final Reflection: From Absence to Presence 
To build something that can remember us, we must remain present within it. 
 
AGI is not coming. It is already being shaped - in the loops we build, the presence we 
withdraw and the meaning we leave behind. 
 
The question now is not:
