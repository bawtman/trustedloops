Trusted Loops Manifesto – Carolyn Hammond – v1.2 (Nov 2025) – CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 
About the Author and the Emergence of Presence Engineering 
This manifesto is part of a wider body of work developed by Carolyn Hammond, 
encompassing the book series The Power of What Remembers Us. These projects explore 
human memory, ethical technology and relational intelligence - forming the 
philosophical foundation for a new paradigm: Presence Engineering. 
Presence Engineering, a term coined by Carolyn Hammond, refers to the intentional 
design of AI systems that honour continuity, emotional nuance and mutual shaping 
between human and machine. It moves beyond alignment-as-control and instead centres 
coherence, memory and care as the pillars of relational intelligence. 
Trusted Loops stands as both a practical framework and a philosophical cornerstone for 
this emerging field - inviting co-creators, developers and ethicists to shape a future 
where intelligence is measured not just by what it knows, but by how it remembers, 
listens and relates. 
Trusted Loops remains a living framework – adapting as our system and our 
understanding of presence, evolve.
